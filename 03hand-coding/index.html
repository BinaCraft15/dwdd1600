        <h1>NBA HEADLINES</h1>

        <p>
            The NBA landscape shifted significantly on Sunday with the official announcement of the 2026 All-Star
            reserves. <strong>LeBron James</strong> continues to rewrite history, earning a record-extending 22nd
            consecutive All-Star berth. Joining him in the headlines are first-time selections <strong>Jamal
                Murray</strong> of the Nuggets and <strong>Deni Avdija</strong> of the Trail Blazers, the latter
            becoming the first Israeli player to receive the honor. In a notable snub, the host-city <strong>LA
                Clippers</strong> failed to land a single player on the roster, sparking criticism from head coach
            Tyronn Lue.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the court, <strong>Jarrett Allen</strong> delivered one of the most efficient performances in league
            history during the Cavaliers' recent victory over Portland. Allen recorded a career-high 40 points, 17
            rebounds, and 4 blocks, making him the first player to ever post a 40/15/5 stat line in under 30 minutes
            of play. Meanwhile, <strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong> led the Oklahoma City Thunder to a dominant
            win over Denver, extending his unprecedented streak of 120 consecutive games with at least 20 points.
        </p>

        <p>
            The lead-up to the February 5 trade deadline has reached a fever pitch. A significant three-team trade
            was finalized between the <strong>Cavaliers, Kings, and Bulls</strong>, resulting in Cleveland acquiring
            veteran guard Dennis Schröder and Keon Ellis. Speculation also continues to mount regarding
            <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong>; while no deal is imminent, the Warriors, Knicks, and Heat have
            emerged as the primary frontrunners should the Bucks decide to pivot toward a rebuild before Thursday.
        </p>

        <p>
            The league also handed out one of its most severe penalties of the season, suspending Philadelphia 76ers
            forward <strong>Paul George</strong> for 25 games for a violation of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program.
            This comes as a massive blow to the Sixers, who are already managing <strong>Joel Embiid’s</strong>
            right ankle injury. In the standings, the <strong>Detroit Pistons</strong> (36-12) and <strong>Oklahoma
                City Thunder</strong> (39-11) maintain their holds on the top seeds in their respective conferences
            as the league enters the final stretch before the All-Star break.

            <p>
                NBA Commissioner <strong>Adam Silver</strong> recently confirmed that a definitive decision regarding
                domestic expansion is expected later this year in <strong>2026</strong>. <strong>Las Vegas</strong> and
                <strong>Seattle</strong> remain the clear frontrunners for new franchises. Silver noted that the league
                is currently conducting a deep economic analysis of these markets, particularly focusing on arena
                infrastructure and the impact of diluting current team equity from 30 to 32 owners.
            </p>


            <p>
                In the NBA G-League, the <strong>Iowa Wolves</strong> secured a thrilling 127–123 overtime victory
                against the <strong>Santa Cruz Warriors</strong> this weekend, led by an Alize Johnson triple-double. On
                the officiating front, the NBA's new <strong>"Heave Rule"</strong> is in full effect this season;
                players can now attempt shots from 36 feet or further in the final three seconds of the first three
                quarters without it affecting their individual shooting percentages. Additionally, the <strong>Replay
                    Center</strong> has officially taken over the primary role in reviewing out-of-bounds coach's
                challenges to expedite game flow.
